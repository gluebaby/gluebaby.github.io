# Backstory

I started work on a replica of the really neat of the original MCCTF gamemode that didn't involve kits, or anything that is normal in modern MCCTF.
It's not finished, but a cool concept, and I hope to either start over or finish it.

# Features

Basically, two teams spend some time mining and getting gear, while seperated by a forcefield. They both defend these weird looking glowstone towers with flags,
and each team has respawns, ah it's so interesting and crazy and I'll do it one day! The coolest part for me is that the teams are called 
"Badger" and "Aardvark" or B and A. Very cute.

# Source Code

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/guthman01/gVanillaCTF) on my github. This is something 
I would actually REALLY appreciate someone assisting with! But don't worry about it too much, cause I'll probably start it over 
at some point.
