# Backstory

I saw some random on SpigotMC ask for a damage API? Like what? Anyways, I decided to make it. And by the time I was done, I decided to just
turn into a plugin. So that's why it exists.


# Features

It tracks just about every damage event in the game, and stores it in a flatfile YAML persistance system, so that even after restarts the server
can hold on to that data. It also utilizes a handy GUI Library from Hazebyte (dinosaur now?) for the paginated gui.
It also has an API that you can access, but more details on the plugin page [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/damage-data.89657/).

# Source Code

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/guthman01/DamageData) on my github.
