# Backstory

As far as I know, this was my first project after leaving InvadedLands. It's been years now but I 
remember working on this with some old friends from that server, and I thought the idea of Player V. Bot combat was kind of unique.
It never took off, but all the pieces are there. 


# Features

LunarPvP is the core plugin I was running, and pretty basic. I had a single kit, but players could upgrade it in a player shop,
similar to MCPVP's KitPvP. It also featured a bounty system, an economy system, stat tracking, rules, help, etc. Basically my 
take on Essentials. Note that while this was not the prettiest code, nor is it entirely OOP friendly, I wouldn't call it full 
of static abuse either. Though now I realize how much better I could have programmed this, it's not something I'm embarassed about.
I probably wrote this when I was 15 or 16. Oh, it also featured a pretty much copy-paste of my King of The Hill plugin (which I am pretty ashamed of).
LunarUtils was the plugin that handled staff stuff, just basic commands. Probably pretty lame code, nothing too special, but still better
than squashing a bunch of preexisting plugins together.

# Source Code

The source code to both these plugins can be found [here](https://github.com/guthman01/LunarPvP) on my github.
