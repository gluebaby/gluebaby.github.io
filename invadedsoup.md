# Backstory

About a year or so ago from now, I programmed a soup pvp plugin for the popular minecraft server invadedlands.net
I later left the server and lost contact with the owner, and because the plugin was unpaid, and because my requests for it
to no longer be used were denied (though now a modified version is in use), I have decided to release it to the public.

# Features

The plugin features a bunch of kits to choose from, as well as an easy method for developers to modify existing kits and create
new ones. If I remember correctly it features a somewhat primitve shop feature with Vault integration. It was set up for InvadedLands,
so if you would like to deploy this plugin you may want to modify it to suit your needs. I only ask that you credit me for my work.

# Source Code

As promised, the source code can be found here on my github: https://github.com/guthman01/invadedsoup
