## Website Update 9/18/21

I'm reorganizing this website to make it more professional, and so that I can use it as somewhat of a portfolio management system. All my old Minecraft Programming/Art projects can be found under the "Misc. Projects" button in the menubar, but as I complete more polished, applied, and less niche engineering related hardware/software projects I will have those center stage and in their appropriate categories.

The other big change is the name; as of now all of my designs, creations, products, etc, will be provided under the brand name PorterfieldDynamics.

In conclusion, if the site feels empty now, it likely is. I will add to it as I complete projects. Thanks!
