## What I'm Listening To Currently

Here's a quick update on the music I've been listening to recently via spotify. Throughout the past few weeks I've spent a fair amount of time listening to They Might Be Giants, a rather obscure experimentalist/comedy band that I was quite fond of as a child.

Some notable songs include:

They Might Be Giants, Sapphire Bullets of Love, Don't Let's Start, Rabid Child, She's an Angel, Nothing's Gonna Change My Clothes, and Birdhouse in Your Soul. 

They have a lot of rather fun and original songs I would recommend checking out, the above are some of my favorites. Here are their best albums in my opinion:

They Might Be Giants, Flood, and No!.

Thats what I've been enjoying over the past couple weeks, and I urge you to check them out!
