# What is This?

MCPVP was the most popular Minecraft server in the world a few years ago, and one that was very dear to my heart. Unfortunately it shut down and was 
picked up by the Brawl network, which is sadly on it's last legs. I had many great memories there, and I'd like to share them with all of you.
So this is essentially an archive of old MCPVP web pages, server plugins, maps, and artwork for you to enjoy.

### 2011

In 2011, Hclewk (Kurtis Welch) started Minecraftpvp.com. It was a hardcore server for the masses,
one that didn't cencor, didn't enforce heavy rules, or attempt to police players. There was only one rule, no hacking.
Otherwise, the players had complete freedom over their actions. They could build, kill, destory, or team up. It was pretty simple,
with occasional pvp tournaments that would have real cash prizes (the good old days).

### 2012 

In 2012, the server shifted from a single gamemode to a variety of fast paced "mini-games." While hardcore pvp was still mcpvp's primary gamemode and server,
gamemodes like CTF (mcctf.com), KitPVP (kitpvp.us), and the hardcore games (mc-hg.com). This was only the beginning of 
what mcpvp was soon to become; a full fledged network.

### 2013

2013 was arguably mcpvp's prime. They were growing quickly, and had launched 3 new gamemodes, Sabotage (mc-sabotage.com), Super Smash PVP (mcsmash.com), and
the lesser known Zone Control (mc-zones.com). Mcpvp was thriving, and averaged thousands of daily players, something quite impressive
so early in the world of Minecraft servers. While hardcore pvp was still going strong, it was clear that quicker, smaller gamemodes
were becoming the focus of mcpvp's resources. As a wise man once said, mc-hg brings in the players, hardcore pvp makes them stay.

### 2014

Ok, maybe I lied a little. 2014 was DEFINITLEY mcpvp's prime. 3 more gamemodes were released, Maze Runner (mc-maze.com), Minecraft Build (minecraftbuild.com),
and Headshot (mcheadshot.com). You may notice a trend here with all 3 of these games. These were definitely the __least__ pvp oriented 
gamemodes mcpvp had under it's belt. This migration away from the hardcore, no rules bloodfest that mcpvp started as created somewhat
of a division between newbies and veterans. Despite this, the server was continuing to thrive and grow, to seemingly no end. Unfortunately,
this quickly took a twist.

### 2015 

"The death of mcpvp." How's that for a dramatic title? No? Ok. Jokes aside, mcpvp had been doing well, at least so it seemed.
A new server partnership with PVPDojo was coming, each of the gamemodes was fairly popular, and mcpvp had at this point made a name for itself
for sure. However, that quickly proved to be false. According to Hclewk's post on May 17, 2015, mcpvp hadn't made a profit in 6 months, starting all
the way back in November of 2014. The iconic "Farewell MCPVP" post explained Brawl's purchase of HG, CTF, and Build, as well as the Minecraftpvp and Mcpvp domains.
The other gamemodes either disappeared into the void, or were picked up by smaller servers. Examples of this include 
mc-maze moving to MunchyMC and Sabotage moving to it's own dedicated server. This day was a sad one for many, as the place
long time players had once called home was no more. 

### Bonus: Mistborn/MCRPG

In 2016, Hclewk came back, seemingly out of nowhere with a new server: MCRPG. This pvp server was largely based on the orignal raid,
yet with a magical twist. The server had gameplay elements inspired by the "Mistborn" series of novels. The server ran rather 
casually for roughly a year, and then suddenly closed down. Currently the website is still up at mcrpg.com, but as of now, 
the state/future of MCRPG is unknown.

### Conclusion:

Sadly, I doubt that Hclewk will come back with another project. Minecraft is not as popular as it was, and has gone in an 
entirely different direction from what made it work so well for mcpvp style gamemodes. I do hope that it's memory lives on,
and that maybe some day a new server will come along and reintroduce thousands of players to the magic of mcpvp. However, no matter what
happens, one thing is for sure; no server that has ever been, or will be, will ever be able to achieve the same level of intamacy between it and 
it's player base that mcpvp was able to achieve. We miss you, and remember you, mcpvp. Rest in peace, 2011 - 2015.
