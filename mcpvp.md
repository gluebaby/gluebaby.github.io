# What is This?

MCPVP was the most popular Minecraft server in the world a few years ago, and one that was very dear to my heart. Unfortunately it shut down and was 
picked up by the Brawl network, which is sadly on it's last legs. I had many great memories there, and I'd like to share them with all of you.
So this is essentially an archive of old MCPVP web pages, server plugins, maps, and artwork for you to enjoy.

## Disclaimer

Most of this content was gotten via leaks and violations of intellectual property. I do NOT condone this, and the files here are not to be used
for any source of economic gain. They are purely for nostalgia and fun. If you are the original creator of any of this work, well hey! Let's chat!
But if you are not comfortable with your work being up here, please shoot me an email, as I do not intend to infringe on anyone's property. With that being said,
most of this stuff is quite old, and therefore extremely different from where it may be used now, i.e  Brawl.

### 2011

In 2011, Hclewk (Kurtis Welch) started Minecraftpvp.com. It was a hardcore server for the masses,
one that didn't cencor, didn't enforce heavy rules, or attempt to police players. There was only one rule, no hacking.
Otherwise, the players had complete freedom over their actions. They could build, kill, destory, or team up. It was pretty simple,
with occasional pvp tournaments that would have real cash prizes (the good old days).
