# Backstory

This was programmed a year or so ago as a favor for a server that no longer exists, so I'm posting it openly. 
Full disclosure, I'm not actually sure if it works. I don't think so. But you are welcome to play around with it and 
modify it.

# Features

Once again, kind of unsure at this point. I think the idea was that it would allow players to teleport to a personal vault.

# Source Code

Source Code can be found on my github [here](https://github.com/guthman01/vaults).
